            <h2>About this site</h2>
            <p>Welcome to my blog - A Writing Retreat, a space dedicated to writing, where I can put down any thoughts, ideas, and inspirations. </p>
            
            <h3>About me</h3>
            <p>I'm Nhu, currently a PhD researcher in Plant Genetics, based in Germany. Beyond academic writing in everyday life, creative expressions play a significant role to me, rooted from my love for literature ever since childhood. </p>
            <p>On this site, you can find two categories, literary and academic blog. The former mostly inspired by my favourite literature works, art pieces, and film/movies, the latter is me sharing technical or general knowledge I learn in my research journey. </p>

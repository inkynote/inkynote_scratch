In mundane life, I gaze at the crescent moon Eyes witness thousands of petals falling in silence Empathy is embracing a butterfly as it fades Realization comes as memories wash in turbid water

I've seen blossoms in words, lost in a trance Tangled beneath a broken red roof Embracing my endless fears, I admire timeâ€™s passage Once trusted, now tearing through engulfing loneliness

Sincerity is a flawless moon Listening to the soft whisper of flowers Happiness found in this simple life Moonlight is my armor Admiring your scarred return Striving to live kindly, washing away loneliness

To love what I once despised Mundane life is brief, yet dreams stretch long
